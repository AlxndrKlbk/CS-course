# Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.
# A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

# Example 1:
# Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
# Output: false
