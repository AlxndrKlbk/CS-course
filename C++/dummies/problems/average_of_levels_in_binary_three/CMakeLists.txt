# Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

# Example 1:
# Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
# Explanation: The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3, on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11.
# Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].

# Example 2:
# Input: root = [3,9,20,15,7]
# Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
