# Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
# The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
# The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

# Example 1:
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

# Example 2:
# Input: root = [1,2]
# Output: 1
