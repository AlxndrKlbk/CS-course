Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.
You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.
Return the answer with the smaller index first.

Example:
Input:
nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7
Output: [0,1]
