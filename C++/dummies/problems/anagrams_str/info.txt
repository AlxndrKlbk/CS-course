Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.
An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"
Output: true

Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"
Output: false
