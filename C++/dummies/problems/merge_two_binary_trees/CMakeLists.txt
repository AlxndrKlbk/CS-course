# You are given two binary trees root1 and root2.
# Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.
#You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node.
# Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.
# Return the merged tree.

# Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

# Example 1:
# Input: root1 = [1,3,2,5], root2 = [2,1,3,null,4,null,7]
# Output: [3,4,5,5,4,null,7]

# Example 2:
# Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [1,2]
# Output: [2,2]
